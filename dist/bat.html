    <h4>The history of Bruce Wayne:</h4>
    <p>
        "Bruce Wayne" redirects here. For other uses, see Bruce Wayne (disambiguation).

        DC Comics concept art of Bruce Wayne by Mikel Jan√≠n
        Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American industrialist. As a child, Bruce witnessed the
        murder of his parents, Dr. Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne, which ultimately led him to craft the Batman persona
        and seek justice against criminals. He resides on the outskirts of Gotham City in his personal residence, Wayne
        Manor. Wayne averts suspicion by acting the part of a superficial playboy idly living off his family's fortune
        and the profits of Wayne Enterprises, his inherited conglomerate.[75][76] He supports philanthropic causes
        through his nonprofit Wayne Foundation, which in part addresses social issues encouraging crime as well as
        assisting victims of it, but is more widely known as a celebrity socialite.[77] In public, he frequently appears
        in the company of high-status women, which encourages tabloid gossip while feigning near-drunkenness with
        consuming large quantities of disguised ginger ale since Wayne is actually a strict teetotaler to maintain his
        physical and mental prowess.[78] Although Bruce Wayne leads an active romantic life, his vigilante activities as
        Batman account for most of his time.[79]

    <h4>Batman's power and gadgets</h4>
    With over 70 years of crimefighting under his utility belt, Batman's crazy technical prowess has left us with a
    lengthy list of cool gadgets. Admirably, most have been tailor made to merely subdue his enemies. But every once in
    a while, even Batman kills, and he has no shortage of lethal devices to choose from to get the job done. And
    although the Dark Knight normally opts to fight his impressive rogues gallery with less fatal outcomes, he certainly
    has the means to permanently turn out their lights.

    <h4>Batman in Justice league:</h4>
    The Justice League is a team of superheroes appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The team first
    appeared in The Brave and the Bold #28 (March 1960). The team was conceived by writer Gardner Fox as a revival of
    the Justice Society of America, a similar team from DC Comics from the 1940s which had been pulled out of print due
    to a decline in sales.

    The Justice League is an all-star ensemble cast of established superhero characters from DC Comics' portfolio.
    Diegetically, these superheroes usually operate independently but occasionally assemble as a team to tackle
    especially formidable villains. This is in contrast to certain other superhero teams such as the X-Men, whose
    characters were created specifically to be part of the team, with the team being central to their identity. The cast
    of the Justice League usually features a few highly popular characters who have their own solo books, such as
    Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman alongside a number of lesser-known characters who benefit from exposure.[1] The
    Justice League was created to boost the profiles and sales of said characters through cross-promotion and helped
    develop the DC Universe as a shared universe, as it is through teams like the Justice League that the setting's
    characters regularly interact with each other.[2
